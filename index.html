  <div class="header">MANIFESTO</div>
  <div class="mission">
    For over 50 years, ever since the first rocket powered a crew into
    orbit, space activities have been the preserve of government-sponsored
    specialists. That era of pioneers is in a transition. Soon more people
    from all walks of life will become involved in this great adventure.
  </div>
  <br />
  <div class="mission">
    Our first polar explorers experienced vast expanses on the surface of
    our planet; for them, it was like ‘space’ on Earth. Those journeys into
    the unknown revealed the human desire for new ideas and destinations.
    Media reports detailing their progress inspired the public’s
    imagination.
  </div>
  <br />
  <div class="mission">
    Today, Space is the final frontier. Our telescopes peer back in time at
    supernovas from long before the first dinosaurs. Soon, the first humans
    will depart for Mars.<br />But first, Space will become the location for
    increased activity by a wider population, of whom the fittest — our
    athletes — will be among them.
  </div>
  <div class="header">
    The Space Athletics Federation exists<br />to make that dream a reality.
  </div>
  <div class="mission">
    The Space Athletics Federation’s primary mission is to educate,
    motivate and activate.<br />
  </div>
  <div class="goals">
    <br />
    Our mission:<br />
    <br />
    ★ Organizing connected sporting events on and off Earth<br />
    ★ Motivating people via SAF™ products, clothing & fitness apps<br />
    ★ Educating members about Space and Sport via published content<br />
    ★ Facilitating research on athletics in Space<br />
    ★ Collaborating with other space sports organisations<br />
    ★ Creating a Space Athletics Federation category for Children<br />
    ★ Building a Metaverse presence and digital goods<br />
    <br />
  </div>
  <div class="mission">
    Being the fastest and the strongest links the realms of Sport and Space.
    Both require a mindset that desires a healthy body, testing individual
    limits, setting new records, and creating firsts.<br />
    <br />
    The global athletics community is also one of the largest, most diverse
    communities on the planet. Membership of the Space Athletics Federation is open to AstroAthletes
    from all backgrounds.
