        <div class="mission">
          For over 50 years, ever since the first rocket powered a crew into
          orbit, space activities have been the preserve of government-sponsored
          specialists. That era of pioneers is in a transition. Soon more people
          from all walks of life will become involved in this great adventure.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="mission">
          Our first polar explorers experienced vast expanses on the surface of
          our planet; for them, it was like ‘space’ on Earth. Those journeys
          into the unknown revealed the human desire for new ideas and
          destinations. Media reports detailing their progress inspired the
          public’s imagination.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div class="mission">
          Today, Space is the final frontier. Our telescopes peer back in time
          at supernovas from long before the first dinosaurs. Soon, the first
          humans will depart for Mars.<br />But first, Space will become the
          location for increased activity by a wider population, of whom the
          fittest — our athletes — will be among them.
        </div>
        <div class="header">
          The Space Athletics Federation exists<br />to make that dream a
          reality.
        </div>
        <div class="mission">
          The Space Athletics Federation’s primary mission is to educate,
          motivate and activate.<br />
        </div>
        <div class="goals">
          <br />
          Our mission:<br />
          <br />
          ★ Organizing connected sporting events on and off Earth<br />
          ★ Motivating people via SAF™ products, clothing & fitness apps<br />
          ★ Educating about Space and Sport via published content<br />
          ★ Facilitating research on athletics in Space<br />
          ★ Collaborating with other space sports organisations<br />
          ★ Creating a Space Athletics Federation category for Children<br />
          ★ Building a Metaverse presence and digital goods<br />
          <br />
        </div>
        <div class="mission">
          Being the fastest and the strongest links the realms of Sport and
          Space. Both require a mindset that desires a healthy body, testing
          individual limits, setting new records, and creating firsts.<br />
          <br />
          The global athletics community is also one of the largest, most
          diverse communities on the planet. Membership of the Space Athletics
          Federation is open to AstroAthletes from all backgrounds.
